# Plugins

This directory contains plugins intended to showcase how 3rd parties can hook into the GraphiQL IDE.

These are core features built as plugins do showcase how to extend the GraphiQL IDE.

Each of these plugins is configured as a separate "build" in the webpack.config.js, which generates a different bundle and *.asset.php, much like would happen for a standalone WordPress plugin using wp-scripts.

Each plugin enqueues it's own scripts, similar to how a 3rd party plugin would do it.
