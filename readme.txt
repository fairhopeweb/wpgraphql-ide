### Major Changes

- 43eea79: Refactored stores, including renaming 'wpgraphql-ide' to 'wpgraphql-ide/app', and adding additional stores such as 'wpgraphql-ide/editor-toolbar.

  Added `registerDocumentEditorToolbarButton` function to public API.

  This function allows registering a new editor toolbar button with the following parameters:

  - `name` (string): The name of the button to register.
  - `config` (Object): The configuration object for the button.
  - `priority` (number, optional): The priority for the button, with lower numbers meaning higher priority. Default is 10.

  Example usage:

  ```js
  const { registerDocumentEditorToolbarButton } = window.WPGraphQLIDE;

  registerDocumentEditorToolbarButton("toggle-auth", toggleAuthButton, 1);
  ```
