## Install

See [releases](https://github.com/josephfusco/wpgraphql-ide/releases) to download, or [download from packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/josephfusco/wpgraphql-ide) via composer.

## Development

1. Install project dependencies.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Compile JavaScript assets.

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

Builds are only required for JS updates as the plugin's CSS is directly enqueued.
